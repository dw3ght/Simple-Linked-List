Hello, my name is Dwight Coles III, and this is a simple project where
I took a partial complete SimpleLinkedList and completed an add method, a
remove method, and a indexOf method. A linked list is a list of nodes and in this project,
you can call many methods to manipulate this list and the nodes. Inside this
project also holds a junit tester where i test and run the project. This
project was created using maven which is a popular build tool for java.

Because we used the build tool Maven, compiling will be different.

To compile:
   - Starting in the project4 directory
   - $ mvn compile

After maven and your terminal run the compiler, you are now ready to test.

To test:
   - Starting in the project4 directory
   - $ mvn test
